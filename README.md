# Vault Installation

Go to
http://localhost:8200/ui/vault

# Download keys Step

Click the "Download keys" button. A JSON file will be downloaded.

# Unseal Step

1. Open the JSON file
2. Enter 3 under the "keys_base64" keys object into vault screen one by one
3. Enter the "root_token" into token screen.

Your data is encrypted and the encryption key is stored in Vaultâ€™s keyring along with all other keys.
The keyring is encrypted with a root key.
The root encryption key is encrypted with the unseal key.

In order for us to access our data, we need the unseal key, which gives us access to the root key, which gives us access
to, what I will call, the final key that decrypts our data!
